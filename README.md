# sales-forecasting
In this Power BI project, I worked on importing, cleaning, and processing data to ensure data accuracy and consistency. I then designed an interactive dashboard, incorporating advanced charts and maps to enhance data visualization. I implemented filters and slicers to enable dynamic data exploration and performed forecasting using Power BIâ€™s built-in features. Additionally, I exported the dashboard as a PDF for reporting purposes. Later, I developed a dedicated sales forecasting dashboard in Power BI, leveraging forecasting tools to analyze sales trends and make data-driven predictions. This end-to-end project helped me gain hands-on experience in Power BI, enhancing my data analysis and visualization skills
